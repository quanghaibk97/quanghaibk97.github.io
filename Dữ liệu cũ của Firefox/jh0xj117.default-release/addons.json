It also works with most video sites like DailyMotion, Facebook, Periscope, Vimeo, Twitch, Liveleak, Vine, UStream, Fox, Bloomberg, RAI, France 2-3, Break, Metacafe and thousands others.\n\nVideo DownloadHelper supports several types of streamings, making the add-on unique amongst Video downloaders: HTTP, MP2T, F4F, â€¦ Whenever a site uses a non-supported streaming technology, Video DownloadHelper is also able to capture directly from the screen and generate a video file out of it.\n\nBesides downloading, Video DownloadHelper is also able to make video conversion (changing audio and video formats) and aggregation (joining separate audio and video to a single file) very easy. This is a commercial feature that helps paying for the free stuff (we need to eat too). You are not compelled to use conversion for downloading videos from web sites, and you can avoid picking variants marked as ADP to avoid the need for aggregation.\n\nYou may want to watch this video about using Video DownloadHelper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZT8yI60k_4\n\nSupport can be obtained from the dedicated support forum.\n\nPlease stay tuned by following us on Twitter (@downloadhelper), Google + or Facebook.","weeklyDownloads":129348,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"mig","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/vi/firefox/user/32479/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/25/25993.png?modified=1543518772","width":200,"height":150,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/25/25993.png?modified=1543518772","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":150,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154820.png?modified=1543518772","width":327,"height":124,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154820.png?modified=1543518772","thumbnailWidth":327,"thumbnailHeight":124,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper animated toobar icon"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154824.png?modified=1543518773","width":250,"height":200,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154824.png?modified=1543518773","thumbnailWidth":250,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154822.png?modified=1543518774","width":361,"height":289,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154822.png?modified=1543518774","thumbnailWidth":361,"thumbnailHeight":289,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154826.png?modified=1543518774","width":320,"height":317,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154826.png?modified=1543518774","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":317,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper available actions"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154828.png?modified=1543518775","width":293,"height":250,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154828.png?modified=1543518775","thumbnailWidth":293,"thumbnailHeight":250,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper quality variants settings"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.2884,"reviewCount":15575,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/vi/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/reviews/","updateDate":1562545565000}],"compatOverrides":[]}
